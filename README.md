# üóÇÔ∏è Task Management - Full Stack Web App
**Task Management** is my first full-stack web application focused on helping individuals manage and track their tasks efficiently. The aim is to provide users with a clean, responsive interface and secure backend where they can manage personal tasks and monitor their progress with ease.

This project is designed to be *scalable*, with future plans to incorporate collaborative features that allow interactions between users.

## üß© Features
- User authentication with JWT (signup, login, logout)
- Create and update personal tasks
- Secure API endpoints with middleware protection
- Clean UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Scalable backend with MongoDB and Mongoose

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add delete and read endpoints for tasks
- Implement user roles and task sharing between users
- Add due dates and status filters (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
- Use Redux or Context API for more efficient state management
- Integrate notifications or reminders
- Deploy the app on platforms like Vercel or Heroku
